The other image directly behind Marco also seems to contain a large object which dominates much of the picture. This is probably a boss from Demons Souls or Sotc but I wonder if this could be Metal Gear Rex or even the original Metal Gear (the warmer colour palette could suggest a scene from Outer Heaven in South Africa).

Does anyone know how long before PS4 gets bricked by Sony? Is it long enough that it makes at least some sense to pick one up now?'),('mvvl1p','CAbsolute','The Smurfing/Twinking Problem','After some time now gaming (a few decades), Iâ€™ve begun to notice that the practice of smurfing/twinking has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. For those of you who are unfamiliar with what Iâ€™m talking about, it is the act of deliberating playing at a level youâ€™re higher than for whichever excuse and or reason. For example in a real life scenario, a pro NBA player going under the guise of a total amateur. Asking to play a game with you or someone in the park or wherever. And utterly annihilating everyone theyâ€™re playing against. \n\nThe average excuses I seem to come across are but not limited to: â€œI do this so that I can play a character/role Iâ€™m unfamiliar with, and not run the risk of losing points on my account.â€ â€œMy stream loves to watch me destroy lesser skilled opponents, and pays me for it.â€ â€œI do this to play with friends who are at a lower level than me.â€ â€œItâ€™s nice to remind new players and trash where they belong.â€ â€œIâ€™ve reached my best possible tier, and now I want the satisfaction of destroying those less skilled than me, because someone else did it to me.â€ \n\nNow, hereâ€™s what I want to know... Since when did gaming as a whole adopt such an awful mentality? And why is it so prevalent today in just about every genre of multiplayer gaming thatâ€™s possible? Some examples are: FPS games, MOBAs, racing games, and even fighting games apparently. Yes. Even people in fighting games. Anyone who has played FighterZ or Street Fighter V can confirm. But again, the question is why? Is it really that serious? \n\nAnd another question. Game developers out there. What steps are you taking to prevent this? And why are so many of you totally shrugging this ongoing issue off as it being totally ok. Are you or arenâ€™t you aware that all youâ€™re doing is allowing players to totally make your ranking systems inaccurate? While also making new players not want to play your game? And in turn telling their buddies of how awful an experience they had? Yes, it can be nice going up against a challenging opponent every here and there, but shouldnâ€™t that be up to individual to decide that? \n\nCase and point, fighting games. As is fighters are a niche genre, that canâ€™t seem to catch a break from the barrier of entry due to skill. Now on top of that, a new player has to deal with players who belong in an entirely different rank farming them for points and laughs. You think the average new player is going to want to put in time to learn this game? To actually get to a point where the various intricacies are fun on a multiplayer level? Probably not. Theyâ€™re going to feel as though they just wasted money and their time. Thus dropping the game. So now what youâ€™re left with are just: Veterans to the franchise, fans/supporters of the franchise, and a few new players during every sale. Only for the vast majority of them to be driven away. You tell me how good that sounds to an already niche genre. Not very good. \n\nSo guys and gals, what can we do to stop this ongoing problem? What can devs do not incentivize doing this? Any feedback would be loved and appreciated.'),('mvw0cu','Fabulous_Potato_162','Day gone 2 sexual','So itâ€™s either it got canceled or itâ€™s just the script is being rewritten . \n\n\nIf you had the chance to make it ,what would you change and what would be the same and how would you want the story to be like .'),('mvw3b8','Fabulous_Potato_162','Day gone 2 sequel','If you had the chance to make it what would you change and keel and how would you want the story to be ?'),('mw63ah','prodias2','Does anyone else think that Doomguy might be less angry if he just had a Doomgirl in his life?','Just a showerthought I had.'),('mw54oe','SkyfireRain','Marvelâ€™s avengers new player question','Hey all,\nJust got the game and Iâ€™m quite impressed with it. \nI am having issues figuring out how it works however, in the operations menu I have 3 types.

This. Is. TERRIBLE.\n\n\n\nTo show how terrible this is: lets look at some prices that you would have to pay for a working retro console with a controller and just 1  obscure retro game.\n\n\n\nFor this, i will use a PS1 and the PS1 version of legend of legaia as the things you are buying.\n\nFor the PS1, i found one on ebay for about  140 dollars thar comes with a controller.\n\n\nAs for legend of legaia, i found it on ebay for 85 dollars (not counting shipping)\n\n140+85=225\n\n\nThats 225$. For a console, controller, and just one game\n\n\n\nAnd, i assume if you are into these games, you want multiple, so lets see what adding another game onto this purchase will cost, lets go with chaos break, which i found on ebay for about 74 dollars (again, not counting shipping)\n\n\n225+74=299\n\n\nThats about 300 dollars for a console, controller, and 2 games\n\n\n\nAnd other games i looked at cost similar amounts to chaos break and legends of legaia, which gets expensive fast\n\n\n\nPlus, getting another console will be expensive aswell, lets say you wanted and n64 with a controller and (assuming you want to use the thing) gauntlet legends\n\n\nI found an n64 on ebay that had the controller bundled in for about 110 dollars (not counting shipping still)\n\n\nI found the game for about 60 dollars (stillll not counting shipping)\n\n110+60=170\n\n\nThats 170 dollars spent on that alone\n\n\nAnd assuming you bought these after the ps1 and the  games for that:\n\n\n299+170=469\n\n\nSo 469 dollars for 2 consoles, 2 controllers, 2 games for one of them, and 1 for the other\n\n\n\nAnd you probably want more than a combined 3 games, so the amount you have to spend keeps going up up and up!\n\n\n\nAnd i know what you are gonna say: what about watching lets plays? \n\n\nAnd to that i say: good luck finding any.\n\n\nThere arent gonna be many lets plays of old obscure games  because they are well, old and obscure.

My parents gave it to me as a gift. Some of the games I played there were Dissidia 012 (I loved that game), Birth by Sleep, Ghost Recon (I canâ€™t remember which Ghost Recon game tho), AC: Bloodlines, and Soul Caliber (Again, I canâ€™t remember which Soul Caliber). I enjoyed playing all of those games although I remember Ghost Recon being super hard since there was a stage or mission that I could never beat. Dissidia 012 was pretty hard too. I think the hardest boss fight in Dissidia 012 was the fight with the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2 with me playing as Firion, the protagonist of FF2. That fight was soooooooo hard. It took me hours to beat him. Phew! \n\n\nThe second (and last) console that I got was the PS3, which I got 2 years after the PSP for Christmas. Itâ€™s probably my favorite console as I have played a lot of games there. Some of the games I played were Assassinâ€™s Creed 1 to 3, Final Fantasy 13, Half-life 2 (and Episode 1 and 2), NBA 2k12 and 2k13, The original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, Just Dance, and Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm. My favorite game out of the bunch was probably Assassinâ€™s Creed 2. That game was beautiful. I was so immersed in the Story and Gameplay of it. But I kinda lost my interest for Assassinâ€™s Creed nowadays but the Ezio Trilogy were really solid. What about you guys?

This. Is. TERRIBLE.\n\n\n\nTo show how terrible this is: lets look at some prices that you would have to pay for a working retro console with a controller and just 1  obscure retro game.\n\n\n\nFor this, i will use a PS1 and the PS1 version of legend of legaia as the things you are buying.\n\nFor the PS1, i found one on ebay for about  140 dollars thar comes with a controller.\n\n\nAs for legend of legaia, i found it on ebay for 85 dollars (not counting shipping)\n\n140+85=225\n\n\nThats 225$. For a console, controller, and just one game\n\n\n\nAnd, i assume if you are into these games, you want multiple, so lets see what adding another game onto this purchase will cost, lets go with chaos break, which i found on ebay for about 74 dollars (again, not counting shipping)\n\n\n225+74=299\n\n\nThats about 300 dollars for a console, controller, and 2 games\n\n\n\nAnd other games i looked at cost similar amounts to chaos break and legends of legaia, which gets expensive fast\n\n\n\nPlus, getting another console will be expensive aswell, lets say you wanted and n64 with a controller and (assuming you want to use the thing) gauntlet legends\n\n\nI found an n64 on ebay that had the controller bundled in for about 110 dollars (not counting shipping still)\n\n\nI found the game for about 60 dollars (stillll not counting shipping)\n\n110+60=170\n\n\nThats 170 dollars spent on that alone\n\n\nAnd assuming you bought these after the ps1 and the  games for that:\n\n\n299+170=469\n\n\nSo 469 dollars for 2 consoles, 2 controllers, 2 games for one of them, and 1 for the other\n\n\n\nAnd you probably want more than a combined 3 games, so the amount you have to spend keeps going up up and up!\n\n\n\nAnd i know what you are gonna say: what about watching lets plays? \n\n\nAnd to that i say: good luck finding any.\n\n\nThere arent gonna be many lets plays of old obscure games  because they are well, old and obscure.

Some developers are greedy and it makes sense , their entire point is to make money not that itâ€™s a good thing , annual sports games made sense in the middle 90â€™s but know outside of player rosters itâ€™s the same god damn thing and people keep buying them ! , loot boxes are loot boxes the systemâ€™s point is to milk money from players after they paid 60 dollars at the end of the da my we have the power and we donâ€™t use it properly , at least there are developers like rockstar , capcom , Id software that actually care about their product not te mention all the indie developers who are basically the soft ones in the industry even thought they become greedy as well over time you know activision ?

I enjoyed playing all of those games although I remember Ghost Recon being super hard since there was a stage or mission that I could never beat. Dissidia 012 was pretty hard too. I think the hardest boss fight in Dissidia 012 was the fight with the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2 with me playing as Firion, the protagonist of FF2. That fight was soooooooo hard. It took me hours to beat him. Phew! \n\n\nThe second (and last) console that I got was the PS3, which I got 2 years after the PSP for Christmas.

My favorite game out of the bunch was probably Assassinâ€™s Creed 2. That game was beautiful. I was so immersed in the Story and Gameplay of it.
